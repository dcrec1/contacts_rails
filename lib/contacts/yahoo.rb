  # = How I can fetch Yahoo Contacts?
  # To gain access to a Yahoo user's data in the Yahoo Address Book Service, 
  # a third-party developer first must ask the owner for permission. You must
  # do that through Yahoo Browser Based Authentication (BBAuth).
  # 
  # This library give you access to Yahoo BBAuth and Yahoo Address Book API. 
  # Just follow the steps below and be happy!
  # 
  # === Registering your app
  # First of all, follow the steps in this 
  # page[http://developer.yahoo.com/wsregapp/] to register your app. If you need
  # some help with that form, you can get it
  # here[http://developer.yahoo.com/auth/appreg.html]. Just two tips: inside
  # <b>Required access scopes</b> in that registration form, choose
  # <b>Yahoo! Address Book with Read Only access</b>. Inside 
  # <b>Authentication method</b> choose <b>Browser Based Authentication</b>.
  #
  # === Configuring your Yahoo YAML
  # After registering your app, you will have an <b>application id</b> and a
  # <b>shared secret</b>. Use their values to fill in the config/contacts.yml 
  # file.
  #
  # === Authenticating your user and fetching his contacts
  # 
  #   yahoo = Contacts::Yahoo.new
  #   auth_url = yahoo.get_authentication_url
  # 
  # Use that *auth_url* to redirect your user to Yahoo BBAuth. He will authenticate
  # there and Yahoo will redirect to your application entrypoint URL (that you provided
  # while registering your app with Yahoo). You have to get the path of that 
  # redirect, let's call it path (if you're using Rails, you can get it through
  # request.request_uri, in the context of an action inside ActionController)
  #
  # Now, to fetch his contacts, just do this:
  #
  #   contacts = wl.contacts(path)
  #   #-> [ ['Fitzgerald', 'fubar@gmail.com', 'fubar@example.com'],
  #         ['William Paginate', 'will.paginate@gmail.com'], ...
  #       ]
  #--
  # This class has two responsibilities:
  # 1. Access the Yahoo Address Book API through Delegated Authentication
  # 2. Import contacts from Yahoo Mail and deliver it inside an Array
  #
