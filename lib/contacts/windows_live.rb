  # = How I can fetch Windows Live Contacts?
  # To gain access to a Windows Live user's data in the Live Contacts service, 
  # a third-party developer first must ask the owner for permission. You must
  # do that through Windows Live Delegated Authentication.
  # 
  # This library give you access to Windows Live Delegated Authentication System
  # and Windows Live Contacts API. Just follow the steps below and be happy!
  # 
  # === Registering your app
  # First of all, follow the steps in this 
  # page[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc287659.aspx] to register your
  # app.
  # 
  # === Configuring your Windows Live YAML
  # After registering your app, you will have an *appid*, a <b>secret key</b> and
  # a <b>return URL</b>. Use their values to fill in the config/contacts.yml file.
  # The policy URL field inside the YAML config file must contain the URL 
  # of the privacy policy of your Web site for Delegated Authentication.
  # 
  # === Authenticating your user and fetching his contacts
  # 
  #   wl = Contacts::WindowsLive.new
  #   auth_url = wl.get_authentication_url
  # 
  # Use that *auth_url* to redirect your user to Windows Live. He will authenticate
  # there and Windows Live will POST to your return URL. You have to get the
  # body of that POST, let's call it post_body. (if you're using Rails, you can 
  # get the POST body through request.raw_post, in the context of an action inside
  # ActionController)
  #
  # Now, to fetch his contacts, just do this:
  #
  #   contacts = wl.contacts(post_body)
  #   #-> [ ['Fitzgerald', 'fubar@gmail.com', 'fubar@example.com'],
  #         ['William Paginate', 'will.paginate@gmail.com'], ...
  #       ]
  #--
  # This class has two responsibilities:
  # 1. Access the Windows Live Contacts API through Delegated Authentication
  # 2. Import contacts from Windows Live and deliver it inside an Array
  #
