h2. ABOUT:

Contact::Rails has several actions that render an 'import' template (import.html.erb fe) with an array of contacts as @contacts.

These actions are called like import_service_contacts (import_google_contacts fe) and they take care of redirecting your users to their accounts for login purpose and then to your templates with the contacts list.

The plugin is built in front of a contacts gem fork created by Hugo Barauna, with some enhancements.

h2. INSTALLATION:

<pre><code>script/plugin install git://github.com/dcrec1/contacts_rails.git</code></pre>

h2. USAGE:

<pre><code>describe HomeController do
  include Contacts::Import
end</code></pre>

Then configure config/contacts.yml. You can find a demo file in vendor/plugins/contacts_rails/lib/contacts.yml.

Now you are ready to define routes like this:

<pre><code>map.import_google '/home/import/google',   :controller => "home", :action => 'import_google_contacts'
map.import_live   '/home/import/live',     :controller => "home", :action => 'import_live_contacts'
map.import_yahoo  '/home/import/yahoo',    :controller => "home", :action => 'import_yahoo_contacts'</code></pre>

Don't forget now to create the 'import' template.
