h2. ABOUT:

Contact::Rails helps you to import a list of Google, Yahoo Windows Live contacts through delegated authentication. The plugin adds actions for each service (import_google_contacts fe) that take care of redirecting your users to their accounts for login purpose and then to a template called 'import' with the contacts list as @contacts.

Contact::Rails is built in front of a contacts gem fork created by Hugo Barauna, with some enhancements.

h2. REQUIREMENTS

zlib
crack
hpricot

h2. INSTALLATION:

<pre><code>script/plugin install git://github.com/dcrec1/contacts_rails.git</code></pre>

h2. USAGE:

<pre><code>class HomeController < ApplicationController do
  include Contacts::Imports
end</code></pre>

Then configure config/contacts.yml. You can find a demo file in vendor/plugins/contacts_rails/lib/contacts.yml.

Now you are ready to define routes like these:

<pre><code>map.import_google '/home/import/google',   :controller => "home", :action => 'import_google_contacts'
map.import_live   '/home/import/live',     :controller => "home", :action => 'import_live_contacts'
map.import_yahoo  '/home/import/yahoo',    :controller => "home", :action => 'import_yahoo_contacts'</code></pre>

Don't forget now to create the 'import' template.
